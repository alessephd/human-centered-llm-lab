# Principles

1. **No black boxes.** If I can’t explain it, I don’t “own” it.
2. **Measure or it didn’t happen.** Claims require metrics.
3. **Human impact is a first-class metric.** Not an afterthought.
4. **Deployment is part of research.** “Works on my machine” is not success.
5. **Version everything.** Model, prompts, guardrails, datasets, evaluations.
6. **Document failures.** Failure modes are knowledge.
7. **Clarity over complexity.** Elegance beats noise.
