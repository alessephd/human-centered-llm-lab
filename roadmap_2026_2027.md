# Roadmap (2026–2027)

## Phase 1 — Foundations (Feb–May 2026)
- [ ] Implement core math building blocks (softmax, cross-entropy, layernorm)
- [ ] Implement self-attention + decoder block from scratch
- [ ] Train tokenizer from scratch
- [ ] Run first “loss goes down” training

## Phase 2 — Training + Evaluation (May–Sep 2026)
- [ ] Stable training loop (AMP, grad clipping, checkpointing)
- [ ] Perplexity + regression harness
- [ ] Generation controls (top-k, top-p, temperature)
- [ ] Human-centered evaluation v1 (risk signals, boundary checks)

## Phase 3 — Deployment + LabHappy (Sep 2026–Feb 2027)
- [ ] Streaming inference API (FastAPI)
- [ ] Observability: latency, tokens/s, cost
- [ ] Safety ledger + audit trail
- [ ] LabHappy integration (RAG, guardrails, monitoring)
- [ ] Paper / technical report + public demo site
