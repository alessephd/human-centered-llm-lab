# Day 001 — Lab initialization (2026-02-18)

## Objective
Initialize the public lab structure and define the experiment protocol.

## Decisions
- Repo structure: research-first, documentation-first
- Two-week cycles: implementation → experiment → metrics → write-up

## Next actions (Day 002)
- Implement softmax + cross entropy from scratch (with tests)
- Start 00_foundations module
