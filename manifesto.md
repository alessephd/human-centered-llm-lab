# Manifesto — Human-Centered LLM Lab

Large language models are becoming infrastructure.  
But infrastructure without human-centered design becomes a quiet source of harm: overconfidence, dependency, misinformation, emotional escalation, and blurred boundaries.

This lab exists to prove a simple idea:

> A language system is not only an optimizer of likelihood.  
> It is a social artifact that shapes behavior, emotion, and agency.

## The mission
Build and deploy a language model system that is:
- technically rigorous
- measurable and reproducible
- accountable in production
- explicitly designed to preserve **human autonomy**, **psychological safety**, and **ethical boundaries**

## The method
Every cycle produces:
- code (implementation)
- experiments (hypothesis → method → results)
- metrics (quality, cost, latency, regressions)
- documentation (why decisions were made)
- deployment notes (when shipped to LabHappy)

This is not a portfolio.  
It is a laboratory.
